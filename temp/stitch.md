First I changed some CSS to adjust the sizes based on padding and reset margin of elements p and fieldset

fallspeed did not adjust because it was outside the scope
in order to change the var you have to make the var public
added a scoreboard by added a cookie that saves and reads
If the score is bigger then the highscore at the end, the score will get over written
The scoreboard will be read the the start of the game

In order to reset the game I simple added a refresh page button
