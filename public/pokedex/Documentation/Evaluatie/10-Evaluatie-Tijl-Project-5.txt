We started the first day slow,
Talking with each other about 'what is the challenge'
Like what do we need to deliver at the end

We divided the tasks
Jaleel would do the Gantt planning
Tayfun and Jerom would start with looking at ways we could build the challenge
I would document
The documenting did not go well at the start but as we came to school each day we would evolve and improve rapidly
At the end I documented more what everyone did, the stand-up and my scripts I wrote

Everyone added ideas to the table
We googled what other people had made
We asked around what others are planning

At the end we came up with this
We are going to build the challenge on Github
We are going to use an API to communicate to the database that will be hosted on a Privet Server
The website will be hosted on Github pages, a free public website host
We will use NoIp to use as DNS
The website will be made from HTML, CSS, Js, NO PHP
The Api will be built will Python
We will use an Api called PokeAPI to get each pokemon in the Pokedex


I ran into a problem after creating the API fetch request Js that loads every Pok√©mon into the html doc using innerHTML +=
my first approach was to save the full result as a cookie, after learning how to do that I also learned that a cookie can not be bigger than 4028b
so this solution will not work, another way to do it would be to save the result of the API as a Json and load that instead, which worked
this way we could still use the sorting system and display script

another problem I had was in Js, where a value would be undefined when called outside a function
I learned how to make a global variable

related to that is creating a better loop for each element in an array
Which was easier then I thought it was
My old way was slower and just made less sense

I created buttons with each a separate function that did a specific thig
I thought this was inefficient so I looked at ways to improve this, I was thinking for a way for the function to know that you clicked a button based on ID
This way each button uses the same function but different variables

Near the end we did some testing with a group in the class
These are the problems we found
Site doesn't work on phone
API is unable to be hosted to the web
Some Js bugs that things wouldn't load under certain circumstances

We ran out of time to create a game but we did have the game mock-up which can be found in the documentation

Today is the final day and looking back
I think we did a lot of things well as not so well
The things I should improve is the start
the documentation and the process
I think the communication was great
I stepped up to make sure we did stand-up meetings and if someone needed help they would come to me
I would tell them who would be able to help since I know who knows what in the class a little bit
This way they would learn more people and learn what they wanted

I asked for imput from my team
They said they learned a lot from me
I was a great 'leader' not a leader but someone who made sure the group could work
Also it has been made clear that my documentation is sometimes confusing, I will use this as something to learn from

As end result I am happy but it also could have been better
I wish we had enough time to host it fully on the internet
And took more time making the starting documentation it would have helped a lot when it comes to understanding and actually continuing
For example we could have used firebase, their Authentication and other features that is semi professional
